#pragma once is a preprocessor directive in C++ that serves as an include guard. Its purpose is to prevent multiple inclusions of the same header file in a translation unit (source file) and its associated headers. It ensures that a header file is included only once, even if it appears in multiple places within the project or in different translation units.

Here's how #pragma once works:

When the preprocessor encounters #pragma once in a header file, it marks the file as included.

If the same header file is encountered again during the compilation process, the preprocessor will recognize that it has been marked as included and will skip including it again. This prevents duplication and potential errors related to multiple inclusions.

Using #pragma once is an alternative to the traditional include guards implemented using macros. The traditional include guard looks like this:

```cpp
#ifndef HEADER_FILE_NAME_H
#define HEADER_FILE_NAME_H

// Header file content here

#endif
```
With #pragma once, you can achieve the same include guard behavior with a single line:

```cpp
#pragma once

// Header file content here
```
Using #pragma once can make your code slightly cleaner and more readable, as you don't need to define and manage custom macros for include guards. It's also widely supported by modern C++ compilers.

However, it's worth noting that #pragma once is a non-standard C++ extension, meaning that it may not be supported by all compilers or in all contexts. Nevertheless, it is widely supported by major compilers (such as GCC, Clang, and MSVC) and is considered safe to use in most cases. If portability is a concern, you can still use the traditional include guards, as they are standard and universally supported.
